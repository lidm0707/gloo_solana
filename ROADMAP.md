# Roadmap: Solana gloo_net Rewrite

## Overview
This project aims to rewrite Solana SDK functionality using `gloo_net` for WASM-compatible HTTP-based interactions with Solana networks (surfpool/simnet and mainnet). The implementation follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and SOLID principles, targeting web environments using Dioxus.

## âœ… Project Status: COMPLETED

This project has been successfully implemented and is ready for use. All core functionality is working and tested.

## Architecture

### Core Principles
- **Single-threaded WASM execution**: All operations must work in WASM's single-threaded model
- **HTTP-based communication**: Use JSON-RPC over HTTP instead of TCP connections
- **DDD Layered Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- **SOLID Principles**: Maintainable and extensible code structure

### Network Support
- **Surfpool (Simnet)**: `http://127.0.0.1:8899` - Local development environment
- **Mainnet**: Production Solana network endpoints
- **Testnet**: Additional testing environments

## Key Implementation Details

### HTTP Client Design
```rust
pub trait HttpClient: Send + Sync {
    async fn post(&self, url: &str, body: RpcRequest) -> Result<RpcResponse, HttpError>;
}

pub struct WasmHttpClient {
    client: gloo_net::http::Client,
}

impl HttpClient for WasmHttpClient {
    async fn post(&self, url: &str, body: RpcRequest) -> Result<RpcResponse, HttpError> {
        // Implementation using gloo_net
    }
}
```

### RPC Client Design
```rust
pub struct SolanaRpcClient {
    http_client: Box<dyn HttpClient>,
    endpoint: String,
}

impl SolanaRpcClient {
    pub async fn get_account_info(&self, pubkey: &Pubkey) -> Result<Option<Account>, RpcError> {
        // Implementation
    }
    
    pub async fn send_transaction(&self, transaction: &Transaction) -> Result<Signature, RpcError> {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Network Configuration
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum Network {
    Mainnet,
    Testnet,
    Devnet,
    Custom(String),
}

impl Network {
    pub fn endpoint(&self) -> &str {
        match self {
            Network::Mainnet => "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com",
            Network::Testnet => "https://api.testnet.solana.com",
            Network::Devnet => "https://api.devnet.solana.com",
            Network::Custom(url) => url,
        }
    }
}

// For surfpool
pub fn surfpool_network() -> Network {
    Network::Custom("http://127.0.0.1:8899".to_string())
}
```
